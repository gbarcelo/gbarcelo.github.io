The quest for knowledge always begins with a question, and humanity's thirst for knowledge is unquenchable. Thus, to be given knowledge can only offer momentary satisfaction; to be taught to find knowledge can offer potentially limitless fulfillment. In order to achieve the greatest fulfillment in the neverending search for knowledge, one must ask the greatest questions.

As those who enter the world of computing quickly find out, a major deciding factor in the speed and efficiency at which one learns and works is the ability to search and find solutions to the countless obstacles that arise in software development. However, one can only search so many manuals, guides, forums, and websites before it becomes apparent that perhaps the more efficient route would be to ask someone who knows the answer. This is where the art of asking a question comes into play: the easier and more attractive a question is to answer, the easier it will be for the asker to accomplish their goals.

So how is a good question crafted? In order to gain insight into the characteristics of good and bad questions, one of each question from Stack Overflow will be reviewed according to the guidelines in Eric Raymond's [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
