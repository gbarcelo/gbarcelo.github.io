As part of my final project for ICS 314 - Software Engineering I course, I participated in a hack-a-thon with the intent of creating a web app using the Meteor framework with React and MongoDB. Together with a team of fellow classmates, we chose to tackle the 'Trash Audit' Challenge and create an app backed by a centralized cloud database that allows users to view and contribute trash audit data.
